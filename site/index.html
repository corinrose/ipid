A protocol, at its core, provides common language for services to communicate about otherwise arbitrarily structured data. The goal of IPID is to coin exactly the vocabulary needed to allow for a consistent, accessible, and safely manipulable <b>data footprint</b> to exist irrelevant of use.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <div class="columntitle">identity</div>
          <p>
An identity is an encapsulation of individuality. An important question for identity is thus: individuality with respect to what? Identification cannot be accomplished without a domain within which to distinguish agents — there's always context. Companies want to sell products to real, individual people, so they attempt to track the use of their service by the real, individual person. As you know, this is incredibly common. Not only is it natural in a sense, it's also really easy given all the person-level identity infrastructure that already exists (e.g. government or financial ID).
          </p>
          <p>
IPID attempts to generalize the default concept of identity above the individual, real person to an agent in the domain of data. An individual is defined not as a human person but as a presence on the internet.

          <div class="columntitle">da·ta foot·print</div>
          <div class="pronunciation">/ˈdādə ˈfo͝otˌprint/</div>
          <p>
A data footprint associates an identity with some data. IPID defines a minimally sufficient footprint as a name and an e-mail. Note that it consists of the smallest useful bit of identity (name) and smallest useful bit of data (contact  information). It's important to mention that identity in general, as IPID interprets it, can still be anonymous with respect to official identity.
          </p>
          <p>
Scaling away from minimally sufficient, a data footprint can contain as much data as the owner of the associated identity would like to include. IPID is designed to let the owner organize as they please and leverages IPFS in its reference implementation to handle that data.

All you need to do is create a profile using our website, and we will take care of the rest. The profile will be hosted on our node, and you'll get an account that you can use to manage that profile.
        </p>
        <p>
This service is a separate feat from designing the protocol itself. By providing a hosting service, we are attempting to show a basic extension of the protocol via a reference implementation. Our single node takes advantage of the protocol to store multiple profiles in a database. This reference implementation doesn't argue to be distributed. It is a centralized service that allows one node to host many profiles — it is builting using IPID not built into IPID.

        <p>
To use the full power of IPID, you can host your own profile on your own node. There are a variety of ways to go about this:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>browser plugin</b></li>
Using js-ipfs, a javascript implementation of IPFS, nodes can run anywhere that javascript can. The browser plugin <a href="https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-companion">IPFS Companion</a> allows you to host an IPFS node in-browser or remotely (accessing it with an HTTP API). You can even run a node locally as a daemon (as you'll see next) and have the browser plugin act as an intermediary between it and the web. This allows your node to seemlessly interact with the websites you visit should they have IPFS functionality.
          <li><b>as a daemon</b></li>
The reference implementation of IPFS is written in Go. Using go-ipfs (or <a href="https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs#protocol-implementations" target="_blank">any other implementation)</a>), you can run an IPFS node as a daemon on your computer locally. On top of that, you can run IPFS Companion in your browser to expose your node just as it would be if it were run in-browser.
        </ul>
